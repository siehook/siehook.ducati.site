      </div>
      <div class="SOTTO_PARA">
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3925"> </a>Multistrada 1200 is equipped with the brand new suspension control system called DSS (Ducati Skyhook System): DSS is a dynamic
            suspension damping control system.
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3927"> </a>Dynamically, the purpose of a vehicle suspension is generally twofold: to allow the vehicle to absorb the surface bumps by
            "filtering" their effects on vehicle chassis (and therefore on the rider) and ensure optimum contact between the wheels and
            the ground. The aim of the DDS is to enhance the comfort level ensured by a normal passive suspension while keeping performance
            unchanged.
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3929"> </a>The DSS relies on the vehicle's sensors to determine its lengthwise and vertical movements, and adjusts suspension damping
            settings accordingly. In particular, the DSS also communicates with the DTC and ABS control units to continuously determine
            the motorcycle status in real time. This results in a generally more comfortable motorcycle, able to better dampen ground
            bumps without affecting handling and with rider always in control. Vertical movements are minimised as well as all sinking
            movements (pitching) that occur under braking and acceleration.
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3931"> </a>The DSS is fully integrated with the motorcycle Riding Modes. By selecting a certain Riding Mode, the rider can establish
            the base suspension behaviour, suspension response and hence the motorcycle response. Then, according to motorcycle dynamics,
            the DSS will intervene and rectify the motorcycle response, regardless of the set Riding Mode, which simply determines the
            base suspension behaviour (i.e. more comfortable for URBAN riding mode and more precise for SPORT riding mode).
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3933"> </a>To better understand this feature, take for instance the URBAN and TOURING Riding Modes. The URBAN Riding Mode is set to offer
            a motorcycle handling suitable for town use: the base suspension behaviour is hence focused on maximising damping of bumps
            and for this reason the suspension will generally feel more comfortable.
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3935"> </a>The TOURING Riding Mode is designed for a more touring use, that is more demanding for the motorcycle and requires a more
            controlled and precise base suspension behaviour. But in both cases the DSS kicks in if the motorcycle behaviour and in particular
            its vertical and lengthwise movements cause poor comfort or poor vehicle performance, no matter if this occurs while riding
            at a consistent speed or under braking or acceleration.

            after 30 seconds;
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3942"> </a>2) when engine is stopped, if instrument panel is turned on but engine is not started, the suspension system power is cut
            after 30 seconds.

      </div>
      <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3945"> </a>When the suspension system is not powered it is quite hard due to the considerable hydraulic damping it offers and this is
         true even when the motorcycle is off. This means that the rider will feel very well when suspension power is cut off.
      </div>

      <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3948"> </a>In key-off (motorcycle off) the motorcycle feels hard because the not powered valves allow just a minimum damping.

            shock absorber for every Riding Mode. When SOFT setting is selected, the DSS will change the suspension settings so as to
            be generally softer; while when HARD setting is selected, the DDS will change the suspension settings so as to be generally
            harder.
         </div>
         <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3991"> </a>The DSS also interfaces with the vehicle load setting, which can range from rider only to rider and passenger with luggage.
            This means that changing the load setting not only affects the rear shock absorber preload - in order to always ensure ideal
            handling even with luggage on-board - but it also affects the parameters determining vehicle dynamic control. So, selecting
            the correct load setting allows a perfect response and handling considering the dynamics generated when riding with luggage.
            It is possible to change the base setting even for the pre-load, thanks to the specific menu in the instrument panel. The
            preload actuator range is 12 mm, the instrument panel allows preload adjustment through 24 positions, which means that every
            position corresponds to a preload change of 0.5 mm. This should ensure the rider to find the perfect setting under any load
            condition.

      <div class="Testo"><a name="d3e3994"> </a>The DSS setting greatly depends on the load setting. Riding the motorcycle with a load setting that does not match the actual
